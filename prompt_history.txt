(Abridged) Prompt History for prompt-history-builder (Feb 2025)

[User] "hey so im trying to learn cmd tools, and built a really small repository..."
- Let’s walk through using Git and cmd to track changes—started the journey to parse chat logs.

[User] "oops the file i saved was the prompt_history"
- Shifted focus to parsing a specific file, revealing the need for flexible project handling.

[User] "actually we want the logs\ and outputs\ under each project within prompt-history builder"
- Defined the nested project structure, splitting dirs and parsing into separate scripts.

[User] "well we havent done anything with git on this project yet"
- Set up Git with .gitignore to share the tool without logs, aiming for a GitHub repo.

[User] "I want to make a new repository on github for this project readme..."
- Finalized the goal: a clean repo with README and root prompt_history.txt for future chats.
